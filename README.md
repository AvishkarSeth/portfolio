## 📚 Research Projects

### 📦 [Drone High-Rise Aerial Delivery](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/7/5/300)  
- Developed a novel drone delivery system to address the unique challenges of delivering packages to multi-story apartments with balconies.
- Utilized Vertical Grid Screening methods to identify precise delivery locations.
- The drone features a 295 mm frame, stereo camera, and ranging sensor.
- Implemented machine learning with a YOLOv5 model for marker recognition, achieving 95% accuracy and 398 ms detection time in outdoor tests.

### 🚁 [Vertical Trajectory Analysis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-29871-4_48)  
- Co-authored a study on optimizing urban drone delivery via autonomous vertical trajectory scanning.
- Developed a real-time visual recognition framework using QR codes to identify apartment levels and units.
- Tested across 3 levels and 10 QR codes, the study compared 4 trajectory patterns, finding the parallel path most efficient for area coverage and speed.
