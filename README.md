## Work Experience- Teaching @ Macquarie University
**Casual Academic- MTRN4068 Wireless Mechatronics (_July 2020 - Present_)**
- This is an advanced undergraduate course that teaches students hands-on experience in designing, building, and programming mobile robots using ROS. The lab sessions aim to develop their skills in ROS, computer vision, motor control, sensor integration, mapping, localization, and navigation. This course is designed and co-taught by me, Subhas Mukhopadhyay, and Alice James. The course is designed to balance theory with an application on hardware.

## Work Experience- Solar Industry @ Quality Solar Sydney
**Wordpress Web Developer & Sales Engineer (_March 2019 - Dec 2020_)**
- Established in Sydney in 2010, Quality Electrical Group operates under the leadership of Mr. Ali Shalkouhi. My role encompassed a range of duties: designing the entire WordPress website, executing SEO strategies, conducting data analytics, and overseeing both Google Business and Facebook advertising campaigns. Additionally, I set up the company's LinkedIn profile and managed the client database to drive sales. (Company Link: https://www.qualitysolarsydney.com.au/) 


## Research Projects
### Drone High-Rise Aerial Delivery with Vertical Grid Screening
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/7/5/300)

Developed a novel drone delivery system to address the unique challenges of delivering packages to multi-story apartments with balconies. Utilized Vertical Grid Screening methods to identify precise delivery locations. The drone features a 295 mm frame, stereo camera, and ranging sensor. Implemented machine learning with a YOLOv5 model for marker recognition, achieving 95% accuracy and 398 ms detection time in outdoor tests. Optimized for last-mile delivery in urban areas.

### Vertical Trajectory Analysis Using QR Code Detection for Drone Delivery Application
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-29871-4_48)

Co-authored a study on optimizing urban drone delivery via autonomous vertical trajectory scanning. Developed a real-time visual recognition framework using QR codes to identify apartment levels and units. Tested across 3 levels and 10 QR codes, the study compared 4 trajectory patterns, finding the parallel path most efficient for area coverage and speed.
